<h1>Unviversity Cyber Project</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
For the University Cyber Attack project, I assumed the role of a cyber security officer and member of the Incident Response Team. Samantha, a teaching staff member, reported abusive and threatening emails received during vacation. The dean provided details including Samantha's name, personal and official email IDs, and information about her involvement in obstructing a student during an exam. My work involved conducting network scans, vulnerability assessments, attack simulations, email forensics, and report compilation to address the incident effectively.
